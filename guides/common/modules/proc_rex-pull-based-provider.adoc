= REX pull based provider 

Remote Execution has been around for a while now and has served SSH-based and Ansible execution very well.
 
Now,foreman have a ‘pull’ based provider that has the features of REX but with a deployment model similar tokatello-agent. 

This uses MQTT as its messaging protocol and includes an MQTT client running on each Host.

In order to tune the MQTT, you can follow the following procedure on the Foreman server:

.Procedure
. Enable the feature using: `foreman-installer --foreman-proxy-plugin-remote-execution-script-mode=pull-mqtt` (this will change the ReX transport mode for the Foreman from the default SSH one to MQTT).
  It’s important to mention that one Foreman server can only use one transport mode: SSH or MQTT

. To bump the default number of clients, create the following system unit definition file and set its contents as specified in the below given example (this will allow the `mosquitto` server to handle ~5000 clients):
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
cat >/etc/systemd/system/mosquitto.service.d/limits.conf <<__EOF__
[Service]
LimitNOFILE=5000
__EOF__
----
. Once the file has been edited, the following commands need to be run to make the tunings come into effect:
+
[options="nowrap", subs="+quotes,verbatim,attributes"]
----
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart mosquitto
